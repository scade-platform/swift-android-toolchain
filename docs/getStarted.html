        <h3 id="findProjectFiles">3. Find project files</h3>
        <pre>
In this section you will continue to explore Android Studio by becoming familiar with the file structure.
1.  In Android Studio, take a look at the Project tab. The Project tab shows the files and folders of your project. When you were setting up your project the package name was com.example.greetingcard. You can see that package right here in the Project tab. A package is basically a folder where code is located. Android Studio organizes the project in a directory structure made up of set of packages.
2.  If necessary, select Android from the drop-down menu in the Project tab.
This is the standard view and organization of files that you use. It's useful when you write code for your project because you can easily access the files you will be working on in your app. However, if you look at the files in a file browser, such as Finder or Windows Explorer, the file hierarchy is organized very differently.

        <pre>
•   To create a new project: open Android Studio, click New Project > Empty Activity > Next, enter a name for your project and then configure its settings.
•   To see how your app looks, use the Preview pane.
•   Composable functions are like regular functions with a few differences: functions names are capitalized, you add the @Composable annotation before the function, @Composable functions can't return anything.
•   A Modifier is used to augment or decorate your composable.
